Just Code and Test followed by deploy to production.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Immediate gratification.  No time spent wringing my hands over what an API call might be.  Just type it interactively in the Python >>> prompt and see what it <em>actually</em> does.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Very, very short design cycles.  Rather than carefully crafting an class hierarchy with bonus interface definitions and proper abstract declarations and overrides, I can just code the classes, unit test them and be done.  </p></li>\\n<li><p>Less code.  Dynamic language introspection reduces the volume of source.  I don\\'t write this stuff in my applications; I depend on frameworks to do this for me.  But the framework-based code is often very short; there are no duplicative declarations that are so common in Java, where you have to repeat things in an XML config.</p></li>\\n<li><p>No mysteries.  As we say in the Python community: \"Use the source, Luke.\"  There\\'s no ambiguity in what a framework does or what an API really means.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Absolute Flexibility.  As our requirements change, we don\\'t have to struggle with devastating changes that break the entire architecture.  We can -- trivially -- make changes to a few classes because Python\\'s Duck Typing eliminates the need to retrofit missing interface definitions where we didn\\'t think they\\'d be needed.  They\\'re just aren\\'t any; the code we didn\\'t write is code we don\\'t have to fix or maintain.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Resilience.  When our actuaries have a brain-fart, we don\\'t have to spend months figuring out how to integrate this new, more sophisticated underwriting model into the apps.  Almost anything can be squeezed in.  Again, this is strictly a consequence of duck typing.  We\\'re freed from force-fitting it into an architecture that couldn\\'t anticipate a new business model.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Since the source <strong>is</strong> the application, the source can be it\\'s own configuration file.  We don\\'t have XML or INI configuration files in some foreign syntax.  We have configuration files in Python.  The Django framework does this and we follow their lead.  We have very complex mocked-up data declarations for sales demo and unit testing.  The super-complex data is actually a collection of Python objects that would have come from a database -- except -- we omitted loading the database.  It\\'s simpler to just tweak the Python object constructor instead of loading a SQL database.</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>[BTW.  After 30+ years of developing software in Cobol, Fortran, PL/I, Java, C, C++, I\\'m just tired of the relatively low-level hand-optimization that most compiled languages require.  Years ago, I read a comment on the inefficiency of most compilers: it leads us to create elaborate build systems to work around the compiler limitations.  We only need <code>make</code> because <code>cc</code> is so slow.]</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Dynamic programming doesn\\'t make you a genius.  It just saves a lot of time.  You still have to manage the learning process.  Things you don\\'t know are hard in all languages.  A dynamic language gives you leverage by allowing you to proceed incrementally, uncovering one new thing at a time without having done a lot of design work only to find your assumptions were wrong.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to write a lot of code based on a misunderstood API, then a dynamic language can help.  You are free to write a lot of code that crashes and burns in a language: C#, VB, C++, Java or Python.  You can always write code which won\\'t work.</p>\\n\\n<p>The compiler gives you some advance warning that the code won\\'t work.  Typically, not compiling is a big hint.  However, you can still write a lot of code that compiles and fails all the unit tests.  The compiler only checks syntax, not semantics.</p'},\n",

       "     'Body': '<h2>Introduction</h2>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Object-Relational Mapping</a> (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. When talking about ORM, most people are referring to a <em>library</em> that implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique, hence the phrase \"an ORM\".</p>\\n\\n<p>An ORM library is a completely ordinary library written in your language of choice that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data, so you don\\'t use SQL anymore; you interact directly with an object in the same language you\\'re using.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, here is a completely imaginary case with a pseudo language:</p>\\n\\n<p>You have a book class, you want to retrieve all the books of which the author is \"Linus\". Manually, you would do something like that:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>book_list = new List();\\nsql = \"SELECT book FROM library WHERE author = \\'Linus\\'\";\\ndata = query(sql); // I over simplify ...\\nwhile (row = data.next())\\n{\\n     book = new Book();\\n     book.setAuthor(row.get(\\'author\\');\\n     book_list.add(book);\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>With an ORM library, it would look like this:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>book_list = BookTable.query(author=\"Linus\");\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>The mechanical part is taken care of automatically via the ORM library.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>\\n\\n<p><strong>Using ORM saves a lot of time because:</strong></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\" rel=\"noreferrer\">DRY</a>: You write your data model in only one place, and it\\'s easier to update, maintain, and reuse the code.</li>\\n<li>A lot of stuff is done automatically, from database handling to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I18N</a>.</li>\\n<li>It forces you to write <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MVC</a> code, which, in the end, makes your code a little cleaner.</li>\\n<li>You don\\'t have to write poorly-formed SQL (most Web programmers really suck at it, because SQL is treated like a \"sub\" language, when in reality it\\'s a very powerful and complex one).</li>\\n<li>Sanitizing; using prepared statements or transactions are as easy as calling a method.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><strong>Using an ORM library is more flexible because:</strong></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>It fits in your natural way of coding (it\\'s your language!).</li>\\n<li>It abstracts the DB system, so you can change it whenever you want.</li>\\n<li>The model is weakly bound to the rest of the application, so you can change it or use it anywhere else.</li>\\n<li>It lets you use OOP goodness like data inheritance without a headache.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><strong>But ORM can be a pain:</strong></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>You have to learn it, and ORM libraries are not lightweight tools;</li>\\n<li>You have to set it up. Same problem.</li>\\n<li>Performance is OK for usual queries, but a SQL master will always do better with his own SQL for big projects.</li>\\n<li>It abstracts the DB. While it\\'s OK if you know what\\'s happening behind the scene, it\\'s a trap for new programmers that can write very greedy statements, like a heavy hit in a <code>for</code> loop.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>How to learn about ORM?</h2>\\n\\n<p>Well, use one. Whichever ORM library you choose, they all use the same principles. There are a lot of ORM libraries around here:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Java: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_(Java)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hibernate</a>.</li>\\n<li>PHP: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propel_(PHP)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Propel</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_(PHP)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Doctrine</a> (I prefer the last one).</li>\\n<li>Python: the Django ORM or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLAlchemy\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SQLAlchemy</a> (My favorite ORM library ever).</li>\\n<li>C#: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHibernate\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NHibernate</a> or <a href=\"https'},\n",

That means you already have everything you need to write a GUI. What that also means is that if you choose to distribute your program, most likely everyone else already has what they need to run your program.</p>\\n\\n<p>Tkinter is mature and stable, and is (at least arguably) quite easy to use.I found it easier to use than wxPython, but obviously that\\'s somewhat subjective. </p>\\n\\n<p>Tkinter gets a bad rap for looking ugly and out of date. While it\\'s true that it\\'s easy to create ugly GUIs with Tkinter, it\\'s also pretty easy to create nice looking GUIs. Tkinter doesn\\'t hold your hand, but it doesn\\'t much get in the way, either. Tkinter looks best on the Mac and Windows since it uses native widgets there, but it looks OK on linux, too. </p>\\n\\n<p>The other point about the look of Tkinter is that, for the most part, look isn\\'t as important as people make it out to be. Most applications written with toolkits such as Tkinter, wxPython, PyQT, etc are special-purpose applications. For the types of applications these toolkits are used for, usability trumps looks. If the look of the application is important, it\\'s easy enough to polish up a Tkinter application.</p>\\n\\n<p>Tkinter has some features that other toolkits don\\'t come close to matching. Variable traces, named fonts, geometry (layout) managers, and the way Tkinter processes events are still the standard to which other toolkits should be judged.   </p>\\n\\n<p>On the downside, Tkinter is a wrapper around a Tcl interpreter that runs inside python. This is mostly invisible to anyone developing with Tkinter, but it sometimes results in error messages that expose this architecture. You\\'ll get an error complaining about a widget with a name like \".1245485.67345\" which will make almost no sense to anyone unless you\\'re also familiar with how Tcl/tk works.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another downside is that Tkinter doesn\\'t have as many pre-built widgets as wxPython. The hierarchical tree widget in Tkinter is a little weak, for example, and there\\'s no built-in table widget. On the other hand, Tkinter\\'s canvas and text widgets are extremely powerful and easy to use. For most types of applications you will write, however, you\\'ll have everything you need. Just don\\'t expect to replicate Microsoft Word or Photoshop with Tkinter. </p>\\n\\n<p>I don\\'t know what the license is for Tkinter, I assume the same as for python as a whole. Tcl/tk has a BSD-style license. </p>\\n\\n<h1><a href=\"http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PyQt</a></h1>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s build on top of <a href=\"http://qt.nokia.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Qt</a>, a C++ framework. It\\'s quite advanced and has some good tools like the Qt Designer to design your applications. You should be aware though, that it doesn\\'t feel like Python 100%, but close to it. The <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.5/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation</a> is excellent</p>\\n\\n<p>This framework is really good. It\\'s being actively developed by Trolltech, who is owned by Nokia. The bindings for Python are developed by Riverbank.</p>\\n\\n<p>PyQt is available under the GPL license or a commercial one. The price of a riverbank PyQt license is about 400 euro per developer.</p>\\n\\n<p>Qt is not only a GUI-framework but has a lot of other classes too, one can create an application by just using Qt classes. (Like SQL, networking, scripting, …)</p>\\n\\n<p>Qt used to emulate GUI elements on every platform but now uses native styles of the platforms (although not native GUI toolkits): see <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.4/qtmac-as-native.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the documentation for Mac OS X</a> and <a href=\"http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.5/qwindowsxpstyle.html#details\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the windows XP style</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Packaging is as simple as running py2exe or pyInstaller.

       "     'Body': '<p>I worked quite a bit on the <code>Zend_Db</code> library, which includes a PHP <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.db.select.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">class for constructing SQL queries</a>.  I decided to punt on trying to handle every imaginable SQL syntax in <code>WHERE</code> and <code>HAVING</code> clauses, for several reasons:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>PHP is a scripting language that parses and compiles code on every request (unless you use a bytecode cache).  So the PHP environment is sensitive to bulky code libraries -- more so than Java or C# or Python or what have you.  It\\'s therefore a high priority to keep libraries as lean as we can.  </p>\\n\\n<p>All of the <code>Zend_Db</code> library I worked on was about 2,000 lines of PHP code.  By contrast, Java Hibernate is on the order of 118K lines of code.  But that\\'s not so much of an issue since a Java library is precompiled and doesn\\'t have to be loaded on every request.</p></li>\\n<li><p>SQL expressions follow a generative grammar that is more compact, and easier to read and maintain that any of the PHP-based construction you showed.  Learning the SQL expression grammar is far easier than learning an API that can simulate it.  You end up supporting a \"simplified grammar.\" Or else you start out that way, and find yourself coerced by your user community into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Feature Creep</a> until your API is unusably complex.</p></li>\\n<li><p>To debug an application that used such an API, you\\'d inevitably need access to the final SQL expression, so it\\'s about the <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001281.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">leakiest abstraction</a> you can have. </p></li>\\n<li><p>The only advantage to using a PHP-based interface for SQL expressions would be that it assists code-completion in smart editors and IDE\\'s.  But when so many of the operators and operands use string constants like <code>\\'&gt;=\\'</code>, you spoil any code-completion intelligence.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p><strong>update:</strong> I just read a good blog article \"<a href=\"http://corte.si/posts/code/farewell-to-orms.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A Farewell to ORMs</a>.\"  The writer, Aldo Cortesi, suggests using the <a href=\"http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/05/sqlexpression.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SQL Expression Language</a> in Python\\'s SQLAlchemy.  Syntactic sugar and operator overloading that is standard in Python (but not supported in PHP) make this a very effective query-generating solution.</p>\\n\\n<p>You might also look at Perl\\'s DBIx::Class, but it ends up being pretty ugly.</p>\\n'},\n",

Clearly, the failures outnumber the successes.</p>\\n\\n<p>What do I base this on?  Two common experiences.</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Once or twice  a year, I have to endure a pitch for a product/language/tool/framework that will Absolutely Change Everything.  My answer has been constant for the last 20 or so years.  Show me someone who needs support and my company will support them.  And that's that.  Never hear from them again.  Let's say I've heard 25 of these.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Once or twice each year, I have to work with a customer who has orphaned technology.  At some point in the past, some clever programming built a tool/framework/library/package that was used internally for several projects.  Then that programmer left.  No one else can figure that darn thing out, and they want us to replace/rewrite it.  Sadly, we can't figure it out either, and our proposal is to rewrite from scratch.  And they complain that their genius built the set of apps in a period of weeks, it can't take us months to rewrite them in Java/Python/VB/C#.  Let's say I've written 25 or so of these kinds of proposals.</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>That's just me, one consultant.</p>\\n\\n<p>Indeed one particularly sad situation was a company who's entire IT software portfolio was written by one clever guy with a private language and tools.  He hadn't left, but he'd realized that his language and toolset had fallen way behind the times -- the state of the art had moved on, and he hadn't.  </p>\\n\\n<p>And the move was -- of course -- in an unexpected direction.  His language and tools were okay, but the world had started to adopt relational databases, and he had absolutely no way to upgrade his junk to move away from flat files.  It was something he had not foreseen.  Indeed, it was something he could not possibly foresee.  [You won't fall into this trap, will you?]</p>\\n\\n<p>So, we talked.  He rewrote a lot of the applications in Plain-Old VAX Fortran (yes, this is a long time ago.)  And he rewrote it to use plain old relational SQL stuff (Ingres, at the time.)</p>\\n\\n<p>After a year of coding, they were having performance problems.  They called me back to review all the great stuff they'd done in replacing the home-built language.  Sadly, they'd done the worst possible relational database design.  Worst possible.  They'd taken their file copies, merges, sorts, and what-not, and implemented each low-level file system operation using SQL, duplicating database rows left, right and center.</p>\\n\\n<p>He was so mired in his private vision of the perfect language, that he couldn't adapt to a relatively common, pervasive new technology.</p>\\n\"},\n",
